% Related Works for Bulletproof: LLM Reasoning Enhancement via Classical Reinforcement Learning

\section{Related Works}

The intersection of reinforcement learning (RL) and large language model (LLM) reasoning has rapidly become a focal point in AI research, driven by the need to move beyond surface-level fluency toward robust, stepwise logical inference. Here, we review the most relevant literature across RL-based fine-tuning, reward function design, evaluation benchmarks, hallucination mitigation, and persistent challenges, situating the Bulletproof project within this evolving landscape.

\subsection{Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning}

The use of RL to align LLMs with human preferences and reasoning objectives was popularized by Ouyang et al. (2022), who introduced Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to fine-tune GPT-3, resulting in the widely adopted InstructGPT model \citep{ouyang2022}. This approach established PPO as a standard for post-training alignment, demonstrating that RL can improve truthfulness and reduce toxicity while making models more responsive to instructions. Building on this, Rafailov et al. (2023) proposed Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a lightweight alternative to PPO that achieves similar or better alignment by reparameterizing the reward objective as a single-step loss \citep{rafailov2023}. DPO's stability and efficiency suggest that much of PPO's benefit for reasoning can be captured with simpler objectives.

Recent work has also shown that RL can be effective even for small, resource-constrained models. Dang and Ngo (2025) demonstrated that a distilled 1.5B parameter model, fine-tuned with a PPO variant (GRPO) and only 7k training examples, could achieve rapid gains on math reasoning benchmarks, surpassing OpenAI's o1-preview model at a fraction of the cost \citep{dang2025}. Havrilla et al. (2024) provide a comprehensive comparison of RL fine-tuning algorithms for LLM reasoning, showing that PPO and Expert Iteration both improve multi-step reasoning, but that RL training often does not explore beyond solutions found by supervised baselines \citep{havrilla2024}. Han et al. (2023) show that dialogue-guided chain-of-thought (DialCoT) with PPO can decompose complex problems into sub-questions, enabling smaller models to achieve state-of-the-art results on arithmetic reasoning \citep{han2023}.

A major milestone in RL for LLM reasoning is DeepSeek-R1 \citep{liang2025}, which uses large-scale RL (with and without supervised warm-up) to unlock complex reasoning behaviors. DeepSeek-R1-Zero, trained purely via RL from scratch, achieved strong reasoning but required subsequent supervised fine-tuning for fluency. The final DeepSeek-R1 model reaches parity with OpenAI's o1 on reasoning tasks, and the open-sourcing of distilled models (1.5B–70B) highlights the scalability of RL-based approaches. Symbolic and tool-assisted feedback is another promising direction: Jha et al. (2024) introduced Reinforcement Learning via Symbolic Feedback (RLSF), where LLMs are fine-tuned using verifiable feedback from theorem provers or code testers rather than fuzzy reward models \citep{jha2024}.

\subsection{Reward Function Design and Hallucination Mitigation}

Reward function design is central to the success of RL-based LLM fine-tuning. Liu et al. (2024) introduced logical consistency scoring as a reward mechanism, penalizing contradictions and encouraging coherent reasoning steps \citep{liu2024}. Sarukkai et al. (2025) further advanced this by automating reward generation using task-specific progress functions, reducing reliance on human annotation \citep{sarukkai2025}. Rita et al. (2024) addressed reward over-optimization by calibrating rewards with human demonstrations, mitigating the risk of models exploiting poorly designed objectives \citep{rita2024}. Zhang et al. (2024) introduced Chain-of-Preference Optimization (CPO), using tree search to guide LLM reasoning and align each step with high-quality reasoning paths \citep{zhang2024}. Lee et al. (2024) proposed CREST, a consistency-driven rationale evaluation method for self-training LLMs to produce logically consistent reasoning \citep{lee2024}.

Several works have focused on hallucination and factuality. Nakano et al. (2022) developed WebGPT, which uses RLHF to train models to issue search queries and cite evidence, with a reward model favoring accurate, well-referenced answers \citep{nakano2022}. Bai et al. (2022) introduced Constitutional AI, where a model-generated preference model (no humans in the loop) rewards outputs that adhere to a set of principles, using AI-generated critiques to curb toxic or illogical outputs \citep{bai2022}. Farquhar et al. (2024) proposed an entropy-based uncertainty measure to detect hallucinations in LLMs \citep{farquhar2024}.

Recent advances also address calibration and self-evaluation. Wang et al. (2024) proposed CREAM, a regularization technique for self-rewarding LLMs that maximizes reward consistency across iterations, stabilizing self-training and preventing drift \citep{wang2024}. Stangel et al. (2024) tackled hallucinations from a calibration perspective, training models via RL to output calibrated confidence scores and rewarding doubt, which helps models avoid confidently incorrect answers \citep{stangel2024}.

\subsection{Evaluation Benchmarks for Reasoning}

The evaluation of reasoning in LLMs has evolved with the introduction of more challenging and diagnostic benchmarks. The ARC Prize (ARC-AGI-2) \citep{chollet2024} is currently the most prominent and unbeaten benchmark for abstract reasoning and general intelligence in AI, with a global competition and leaderboard that includes all major reasoning models and research labs. ARC-AGI-2 is specifically designed to stress test the efficiency and capability of state-of-the-art AI reasoning systems, requiring compositional, contextual, and symbolic reasoning that remains easy for humans but extremely difficult for AI. Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) \citep{phan2025} builds on the tradition of ARC, expanding the evaluation to 2,500+ expert-crafted questions across diverse disciplines. Both ARC and HLE expose the limitations of current models, with even the best systems scoring far below human experts. LogicGame \citep{gui2024} and Math-RoB \citep{yu2024} further probe rule-based reasoning and robustness, revealing that many purported reasoning gains are brittle. PlanBench \citep{valmeekam2023} and BIG-Bench Hard \citep{srivastava2022} focus on planning, multi-step reasoning, and adversarial robustness, while TruthfulQA \citep{lin2022} tests adversarial truthfulness and factual consistency.

\subsection{Reasoning-Focused LLM Models and Architectures}

Recent years have seen the emergence of LLMs explicitly designed for reasoning. DeepSeek-R1 \citep{liang2025} is an open-source model trained for high-level reasoning using RL, achieving performance on par with proprietary models like OpenAI's o1. Lewkowycz et al. (2022) introduced Minerva, a specialized LLM for mathematical and scientific reasoning, showing that targeted training on high-quality reasoning data enables rigorous, stepwise solutions \citep{lewkowycz2022}. These models set new bars for reasoning-heavy benchmarks and demonstrate the value of structured reasoning data and RL-based fine-tuning.

\subsection{Surveys and Synthesis}

Comprehensive surveys such as Wu (2025) \citep{wu2025} provide an overview of post-training alignment techniques for LLMs, including RLHF, reward-assisted decoding, and self-correction. These works emphasize that reward design is now a key lever for eliciting reasoning, and highlight challenges such as reward hacking, interpretability, and the need for grounded, externally verifiable rewards.

\subsection{Summary and Positioning of Bulletproof}

In summary, the literature demonstrates that RL-based fine-tuning—especially with carefully designed, multi-faceted reward functions—can substantially improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, challenges remain in ensuring logical consistency, factuality, calibration, and robustness to adversarial prompts. Bulletproof builds on these advances by combining PPO-based RL with structured reasoning tokens and automated, multi-component reward functions, aiming to bridge the gap between pattern-matching and genuine logical inference in open-source models. By systematically evaluating on HLE, ARC, and related benchmarks, Bulletproof contributes new insights into the design and evaluation of RL-enhanced reasoning in LLMs.
